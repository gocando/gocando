## Hi, I'm Grecia

🎓 I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Florida. <br/>
🛠️ I recently finished building a C-style interpreter (littleC), including a custom lexer and parser.<br/>
🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to expand my skill set in web development.<br/>
🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that combine creativity and engineering, like apps, games, or productivity tools.<br/>
